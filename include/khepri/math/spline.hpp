 * @brief A cubic spline

 * A cubic spline is a spline that follows a set of predefined control points.
 * By defining third-order (cubic) polynomial segments between every adjacent set of control points,
 * the resulting curve runs smoothly through every control point. This line can be interpolated at
 * any point from start to finish. Sampling at regular intervals is guaranteed to return points
 * that are at identical distances along the curve.
